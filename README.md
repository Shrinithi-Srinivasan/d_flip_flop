# D Flip-Flop Overview
Definition: A D (Data or Delay) Flip-Flop is a type of digital storage element used in sequential logic circuits to store one bit of data.
Basic Functionality: Captures the value of the input D at a specific edge (usually the rising edge) of the clock signal and outputs it at Q.
# Symbol:
Input: D (Data), CLK (Clock), optional RESET or SET
Output: Q, optionally Q' (inverted)
# Edge Triggered: 
Most D Flip-Flops are triggered on the rising edge (↑) or falling edge (↓) of the clock.
# No Feedback Loop: 
Compared to latches, D Flip-Flops eliminate the risk of feedback-induced instability by sampling only at clock transitions.
# Applications:
Used in data storage, registers, counters, and memory elements.
Acts as a 1-bit memory cell in sequential circuits.
# Characteristic Equation: 
Q(next) = D (on the clock edge)
# Timing Considerations:
Setup time: Minimum time D must be stable before the clock edge.
Hold time: Minimum time D must remain stable after the clock edge.
